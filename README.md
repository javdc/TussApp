## Description

With **TussApp** you can view information about bus stops, lines and real-time estimations for the next bus arrival. You can also save your cards and view the balance and other information everytime you want. The data is retrieved from the official API used in AppTUSSAM, which was reverse-engineered to re-implement it here.

*Disclaimer: TussApp is not affiliated in any way with TUSSAM.*
